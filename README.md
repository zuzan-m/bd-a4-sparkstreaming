Twitter streaming with Spark

**Task 1** Use SparkStreaming to develop an application that detects a given type of events (e.g. concerts) in the Twitter stream. Run some semantic analysis on the tweets to determine if they appear to be referencing a current event. Visualize the results.

**Task 2** Use SparkStreaming to identify trending Twitter hashtags.

---

taskx_twitter_app sends tweets' text to localhost, taskx_spark_app receives those tweets and does the real time analysis in Spark.
